UpdateChecker
=============
Built on forge for MC 1.6.4, but should work with all versions until something changes
Features:
	-displays to player in chat upon login
	-only checks against the installed MC version (doesn't tell you the mod is out of date when you have the newest compatible version)
	-only tells the player the first time on the server in the current session -doesn't tell the player on every level change
	-displays change logs for the newer versions
	-smart version checker attempts to make a logical decision if found versions are newer than the current one, no matter how convoluted the numbering is
	-easy to install
	-all you need to provide is a test file host
	
Summary:
	a simple (not in the slightest) class that allows you to easily add the ability to check if your forge mod is up to date.
